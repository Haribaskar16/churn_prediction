# Churn-prediction

## Project Overview ##

This project analyzes the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify factors that influence customer churn and propose data-driven strategies to reduce it.
Churn (when customers stop using a service) is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based businesses. By analyzing customer behavior, tenure, monthly charges, and contracts.

- Understand why customers churn

- Build visualizations & insights

- Propose business strategies to improve retention

- Suggest advanced improvements like predictive modeling and A/B testing

### Tech Stack ###

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Jupyter / Google Colab for analysis

- GitHub for version control

- Scikit-learn, XGBoost for ML models

- Power BI for dashboards

## Dataset ##

### Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset ###

### Columns include: ###

- customerID – Unique identifier

- tenure – Number of months the customer has stayed

- MonthlyCharges – Current monthly bill

- TotalCharges – Total amount charged

- PaymentMethod, InternetService, Churn, etc.

## Analysis & Insights ##

1. Tenure Analysis

- 0–12 months customers → Highest churn risk

- 13–36 months customers → Moderate churn

- 37+ months customers → Lowest churn (loyal customers)

2. Monthly Charges

- Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn

- Strategies: offer discounts, bundled packages, loyalty rewards

3. Churn Breakdown

- Most churners are on month-to-month contracts

- Electronic check users churn more compared to auto-payment methods

## Advanced Improvements ##

- Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

- Feature Engineering (usage trends, payment stability, CLV)

- Clustering for Customer Segmentation

- Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)
